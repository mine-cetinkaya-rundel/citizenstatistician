<p>Last week I attended the <a href="https://rohanalexander.com/reproducibility.html">Toronto Workshop on Reproducibility</a> where I had to the pleasure of giving one of the keynotes.</p>
<p>When I was asked to give a keynote for this event on teaching, I had the idea of reflecting on almost 9 years of teaching with introductory statistics and data science through the lens of reproducibility. I would have said “teaching with R Markdown”, but looking back through my notes, this wasn’t true as the <a href="https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/docs/">rmarkdown</a> package has not been around for that long – turns out I started teaching with it when it was just <a href="https://yihui.org/knitr/">knitr</a>. Frankly, some of the details are blurry, but as I explained in my talk, I remember sitting in the audience at useR! 2012 in Nashville where Yihui and JJ introduced knitr <a href="https://slides.yihui.org/2012-knitr-RStudio.html">in their keynote</a>, and literally updating my course labs while I was sitting there to use knitr!</p>
<p>This was also an opportunity to reflect on and discuss what changed (and what didn’t) since <a href="http://www.citizen-statistician.org/2012/10/planting-seeds-of-reproducibility-with-knitr-and-markdown/">my first blog post on Citizen Statistician</a> which was on this topic and <a href="https://escholarship.org/uc/item/90b2f5xh">our paper</a> on teaching with R Markdown that is still very relevant today.</p>
<p>Video of the talk and slides are below.</p>

<p>I should also say a few words about the title of the talk and the cover slide. As I was brainstorming ideas with <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~cr173/">Colin</a>, he told me about the essay by Neal Stephenson called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_the_Beginning..._Was_the_Command_Line">In the Beginning… Was the Command Line</a>. I had not read it at the time, but I have now! The title is a loose take on this, even though the content of the talk is not at all based on it. I also really liked the cover of the book and decided to style my talk title slides based on it.</p>
<p>Given that this is a talk on reproducibility, I didn’t have the heart to not generate this image reproducibly, so I forked <a href="https://sharla.party/">Sharla Gelfand</a>’s <a href="https://github.com/sharlagelfand/ggkeyboard">ggkeyboard</a> package and altered it a bit to get what I need. You can find my version (that is only useful for generating this image) <a href="https://github.com/mine-cetinkaya-rundel/ggkeyboard">here</a>.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># devtools::install_github(&quot;mine-cetinkaya-rundel/ggkeyboard&quot;)
library(ggkeyboard)

ggkeyboard(
  in_the_beginning_full, 
  palette = keyboard_palette(&quot;in_the_beginning&quot;), 
  adjust_text_colour = FALSE
)</code></pre>
<p><img src="{{< blogdown/postref >}}index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" title="Keyboard that spells out 'In the beginning was R Markdown' in the keys." alt="Keyboard that spells out 'In the beginning was R Markdown' in the keys." width="100%" /></p>
<p>Once I got the keyboard layout working I searched around for color inspiration on <a href="http://same.energy/">same.energy</a> where I stumbled upon <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CFcKz89nWE0">this gorgeous design</a> and used the Digital Color Meter app on my Mac to create a palette for the cover image and the talk.</p>
<p>If you’d like to do something similar yourself, all it takes is to edit the CSV files in the <code>data-raw</code> folder for your desired output. You can then update the package data with <code>usethis::use_data()</code> and use the new keyboard style you created in one of the functions provided by the package. If you want to give this a try I recommend starting from Sharla’s package and using my fork in case you’re curious how I went about it.</p>
<p>Finally, in case you only read this and don’t get a chance to watch the video or look through the slides, the talk ends with</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginning was R Markdown and R Markdown continues to facilitate reproducibility,
no matter your scope and experience.</p>
</blockquote>
